# Face Detection Counter
A Python OpenCV project that detects and counts faces in real-time using webcam feed.
# NOTE
The project has other files that outline my process of getting to the live face counter, as this is my first project using OpenCV and I made this while trying to learn to code in OpenCV so I can use it for an upcoming bigger project. The final file that performs the function of detecting and counting faces is "countfaceslive.py".

# Technology used:
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Haar Cascade Classifier

# Facts and Features:
- Real-time performance with OpenCV, using webcam feed
- Detects human faces using the Haar Cascade Classifier 
- Draws a rectangle around detected faces
- Counts the number of faces appearing in the webcam feed
